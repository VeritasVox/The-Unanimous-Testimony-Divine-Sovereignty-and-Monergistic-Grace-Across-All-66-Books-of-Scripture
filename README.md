# The-Unanimous-Testimony-Divine-Sovereignty-and-Monergistic-Grace-Across-All-66-Books-of-Scripture
66 books. Zero exceptions. An exegetical proof that every canonical book teaches God's absolute sovereignty and monergistic grace. Addresses all synergist proof-texts at the pericope level. The burden now rests on those who deny it. Soli Deo Gloria.
